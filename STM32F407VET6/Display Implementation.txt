âœ… Updated I2C Pin Selection
Letâ€™s use I2C3, which is not used in your project and maps cleanly to:
|  |  |  | 
|  |  |  | 
|  |  |  | 
|  |  |  | 
|  |  |  | 


These pins are free in your layout and donâ€™t conflict with MSX bus or control signals.

ðŸ§  Integration Strategy
- Enable I2C3 in CubeMX or manually configure:
- Set PA8 and PC9 to Alternate Function 4 (AF4)
- Enable I2C3 clock
- Configure timing for ~100kHz or 400kHz depending on your display
- Initialize Display using a library like u8g2 or ssd1306-stm32HAL.
- Update Display on File Change:
- Hook into your file selection logic (where PREV/NEXT updates the filename)
- Call display_show_filename(filename) to refresh the screen

ðŸ§© Example Hook
Assuming you have a char selected_filename[64]; updated by button presses:
void on_file_selected(const char *filename) {
    strncpy(selected_filename, filename, sizeof(selected_filename));
    display_show_filename(selected_filename);
}



Would you like me to help you patch this into your existing main.c or generate a CubeMX .ioc snippet for I2C3 setup? I can also annotate the display update logic to match your documentation style.
